# Intel gathering for Utopia Ponies

This repository won't mean a thing unless you're one of the few people that play http://utopia-game.com.
Frustrated by the limitations (and bugs) of existing tools, we (a group of players -- a kingdom -- called Utopia Ponies) are trying to figure out how to take advantage of the new built-in intel feature of the game, and to process that information in a way that benefits us the most (and bug-free hopefully).
